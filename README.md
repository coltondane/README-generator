## Description
    This application utilizes inquirer.js to prompt the user/developer for answers that  will be insterted into a README.md file for them. This eliminates the headache of having to create a new README file from scratch for every new application that a developer makes. Ultimately making their life easier, and giving all of their README files the same overall structure. Making sure they dont forget to add anything. The application also does things like adding license descriptions and badges so that the developer doesnt have to copy/paste the descriptions for every new application.
