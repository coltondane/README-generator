## Description
    This application takes into account user input in the CLI via inquirer to gather attributes for a logo that will be generated as an SVG. The user has to first input a string of three letters or less for their logo, along with the text and background color, as well as the shape they would like their logo to take. After the user inputs the required information, a logo.svg file will be generated that the user can then access and view their new logo.
